# Day 20-GUVI

> **Weather App**  
> [Source Code](./index.html)  
> Explanation:
>
> First, we create an _index.html_ file to which we add our _script.js_ and _style.css_ files using _script_ and _link_ tags respectively.
> The page is styled using raw CSS and BootstrapCSS.
> Now, in our JavaScript code, first we declare the API Key and URL as a **const** variable.
> Required images are saved in the images directory.
> Let's get into the Code flow:
>
> - We create a home page named as **index.html**, which contains a navbar and 2 buttons for navigation.
> - First, we dive into the Weather page.
> - This page contains an input field to receive the location as an input from the user.
> - The location is then picked in javascript, and the API call is made by using Fetch API.
> - The response is then rendered as a class in the front-end using bootstrap classes.
> - Finally, we come to the Astronomy page of the App.
> - Here once again, we get an input from the user by rendering an input field.
> - The value is selected with JS and an API call is made using Fetch API.
> - Finally, the response is then rendered to the frontend with icons to make it more user friendly.
